# Gitlab Issue submission form
Here's a little NodeJS project that I wrote up for submitting Gitlab issues via a form.

The Gitlab interface is great, but can be a little overwhelming for the non-technical. This form is setup to submit to a pre-defined list of projects (based on Group).

Todos:
- The Gitlab API on the public version is SLLLOOOWWW, so the UI is a little laggy. Move to Angular JS and put in some loading animations.
- Better error handling, validation and sanitization
- Logging.
